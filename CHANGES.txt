- 9/8/20 CP: in prelims/models.py, changed import of 'ZopeTransactionExtension' to 'register'
because pserve development.ini --reload was throwing an error:
ImportError: cannot import name 'ZopeTransactionExtension' from 'zope.sqlalchemy'
Solution found: https://github.com/zopefoundation/zope.sqlalchemy/issues/37

- Setup notes:
You can follow the README.md file with these modifications:
CP used PyCharm and setup the virtualenv by going to Settings/Preferences > Project:prelims_scheduler > Project Interpreter. Use Python 3.7
After installing the packages, start the venv: source venv/Scripts/activate
Then copy exampledb.sqlite as prelims.sqlite
Start the server: pserve development.ini --reload
